The model struggled with adhering to precise technical specifications, a critical weakness for production-level systems. Reviewers noted that while core features were implemented correctly, Gemini deviated on key requirements, such as substituting the requested AES-256 encryption with Fernet (which uses AES-128 internally) and failing to enforce offline-only dependencies. These seemingly minor mismatches demonstrate a lack of attention to detail that could compromise security and operational integrity in a real-world EdTech application.\n\nPrompt ID 369 (Knowledge Graph Recommendations): While Gemini 2.5 pro received two 5's for its outstanding algorithmic solutions, its performance was not consistently perfect. The perfect scores were awarded for its mathematically sound use of NetworkX's min-cost flow algorithms and a logically correct Personalized PageRank implementation on a reversed graph. However, one evaluation resulted in a score of 4 because the `min_cost_flow()` logic was only partially defined and lacked a complete implementation, which critically limited the end-to-end functionality of the solution. This inconsistency suggests a reliability issue, as the model can produce both robust, correct code and incomplete placeholders for the same complex problem.",
